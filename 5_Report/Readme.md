            In this project topic was Led Indicator, using ATmega328p is an Advanced Virtual Risc (AVR) micro-controller. In this project using Embedded c program and using components like Relay (switch), buzzer, led, fixed volt and ATmega328p micro-controller. In ATmega38p micro=controller pin is connected to 8 led and buzzer in order to indicate .when the current flow in Relay ,it will On the buzzer make sound and led will glow.
ATMEL STUDIO-
• Software tool used for coding is Atmel studio and atmega328 processor is used in order to compile and run the program.In atmel studio first the new project is created and the microcontroller is selected in order to done the project.
• Embedded C coding is done then we should save the file after that we should compile and build the file in order to run in simulide.
SIMULIDE-
• SIMULIDE is used in order for simulation of the project.
• In simulide atmega328 microcontroller is used and it includes components like Relay(switch). led to run the project and check the result.After the simulation setup the microcontroller is loaded with firmware to open the code hexafile and the project is executed and the result is obtained.

In the project topic was Led indicator, using ATmega3289 is an Advanced Virtual Risc (AVR) microcontroller and it has 32KB Internal Flash Memory.In this project using 
compountent like Relay,Led,buzzer and fixed volt.The relay is an electrical switch is connected to port D is an 8-bit input/output port ,and led are connected same
8-bit bidirectional port B and the fixed volt range is 5V.In AVR C program is monitor the Relay Led and bazzer,when the current is flow in relay the buzzer will  ON and it make some sound and led will glow. So this procee are done using embedded C.
